          My journey in tech began with Girls Who Code Summer Immersion program back in 2017
          where I learned to code in Python and Javascript for the first time. 
          I enjoyed it so much I decided then to make it my career üë©üèª‚Äçüíª

            <p>
              I hold a <mark> Bachelors Degree in Web and Mobile Computing </mark> from 
              Rochester Institute of Technology, and I've been fortunate to work on a 
              range of projects from building web applications to creating fun games such as whack-a-mole.
              My technical skills include proficiency in <mark>Python, Java, and JavaScript</mark> with experience 
              in frameworks like React and Node.js.  
            </p>
            <p> 
              When I'm not coding, you'll find me enjoying playing card games with friends trying out a new local cafe.
              I also love attending tech meetups and staying active in the developer community.
